// John is very much interested in Mathematics. One day when he was learning about different
// types of mathematical numbers, he came across a concept of “GOOD Number”. If there is no
// “Zero” in the number, then it is a GOOD number. John is a beginner in C programming and
// he needs your help to solve it.
